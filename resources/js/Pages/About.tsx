            <p>
                I studied Information Technology at London South Bank University, where I 
                learned about developing websites using HTML, CSS, and PHP. 
                Shortly afterwards I was hired by Sykes Cottages to join their team and
                develop secure, scalable, and high performing web pages in both PHP and
                WordPress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having left Sykes, I am now available for any new contracts, standalone
                projects, or even new roles as a software engineer. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                If you're looking for a talented engineer to join your team or to work on
                your web development projects, email or call me!
            </p>
